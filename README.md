# Manuel Portfolio

In case you don't know I'm **Manuel Rivas** and this is a (*my*) portfolio made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### Why nextjs?

Well, I could've been used *react* or even the web development *orion
belt* (HTML, CSS, JS). But I decided to practice the nextjs framework although
it's an obvious overkill due to the nature of this project.

### Run locally

Feel free to clone this repo and run it locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
